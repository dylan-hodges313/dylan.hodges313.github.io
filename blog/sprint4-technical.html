   <h2>What problem did you encounter and how did you solve it?</h2>
    <p>
    I ran into a fairly big problem with motivation. I started falling behind and felt like I wouldn’t be able to catch up and developed a defeatist attitude. 
    </p>
    <h2>How did I solve this problem?</h2>
    <p>
    To begin I started by reaching out to my facilitator and talking to him about this. I even said I may leave the program. He told me he understood and gave me reassurances. This sparked a drive in me to catch up. I ended up talking to my Nana who is great with time management and keeping me motivated and asked her if i could spend a week with her and i can get everything done i needed to.
    </p>
    <h2>How did I feel throughout the process and what did I learn?</h2>
    <p>
    I felt motivated to catch up. I learned some very good time management strategies and how to prioritise my work.
    </p>
    <h2>Of the following methods how confident are you?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> not very confidant. I Don't understand how it works.</li>
            <li><strong>Trying something:</strong> I will try something if I feel like it won’t break my code too badly.</li>
            <li><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I don't have a rubber duck :(</li>
            <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> the red text is daunting but I manage to break it down.</li>
            <li><strong>Console logging:</strong> mediocre</li>
            <li><strong>Googling:</strong> google and I have become great friends over the duration of this course</li>
            <li><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> I have some anxiety asking my peers for help but they are all very knowledgeable. So i suck it up and ask them.</li>
            <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I also have some anxiety asking coaches for help but they are also very knowledgeable and willing to help.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> reflection isn’t my strong suit.</li>
        </ul>
