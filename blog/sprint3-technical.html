    <h2>What is JavaScripts relationship with HTML and CSS?</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript adds interactivity to your Web documents. By means of Interactive maps, side scrolling sideshows, animations and many more methods. 
  </p>    
   <h2>What analogy can you think of to describe the relationship between these three languages?</h2>
    <p>
    An analogy I can think of is to think of it as a room in your house. 
    Html provides the foundation. The walls, the roof and the floor. 
    CSS makes it look pretty. It’s the paint/wallpaper. It’s the tiling hte carpet and wall art.
    JavaScript rings in everything that's interactable . the cupboards, the TV, the Couch and anything else you interact with in the room.
  </p>
    <h2>What is control flow and looping?</h2>
    <p>
    Code is read from top to bottom. Exactly like a recipe. An example of flow control and looping would be baking a cake.
  <br>
    The process would be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make cake. (I don’t wanna write the entire process of baking a cake)
    <li>Cake is in the oven
    <li>Start loop:
    <li>If (cake is runny)
    <li>Pierce top of cake with skewer
    <li>Check
    <li> Else 
    <li>Remove from the oven
    <li>Ice the cake.
  </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
    <p>
    Dom stands for Document Object Model.
    It is considered the glue that Holds HTML and CSS together. The DOM has 2 main features
    Objects which are what we can use to manipulate the webpage.
    Nodes which make up every single thing the document contains. Ranging from Arrays to headers.
  </p>
    <h2>What is the difference between Arrays and Objects?</h2>
  <p>  
    Arrays are a collection of things  that each have their own indexing number. A function can call upon the entire Array or each different thing within the Array via the associated indexing number.
    Whereas objects have keys with a property assigned to it. The properties assigned to a key can also be an Array.
  </p>
    <h2>What is A function?</h2>
    <p>
    A Function is a piece of code that can be used to automate specific tasks. Depending on what conditions and inputs have been set.
