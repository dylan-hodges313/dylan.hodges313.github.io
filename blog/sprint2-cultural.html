  <h2>What is my learning plan?</h2>
    <h3>reflection on my learning Journey so far</h3>
    <p>
      For as long as i can remember I have been unsure of my learning capabilities. 
<br>
      I think this is because during College I wasn't given the freedom to explore it.
<br>
      I have taken this Program as an opportunity to take the time to explore differnet learning means.
<br>
      I have tried:
      <ul>
        <li>Making lists</li>
        <li>Exploring different media style</li>
        <li>Explaining concepts to my roommates</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      What I have learned from this experimentation is that lists help me keep my thoughts organised and present. this is good for me because I am a forgetful person.
<br>
      I have also learned that I learn better when watching videos where something is explained and at the same time being demonatrated in real time.
    </p>
  <h2>Career path and long term goals</h2>
    <p>My long term goal is to become a home owner.
<br>
    I haven't considered my career path but i can see myself working on a development team working on something the world needs.
    </p>
  <h2>what skills would I like to be developed?</h2>
    <p>
      I would like to have my teamwork skills and communication skills developed.
    </p>
  <h2>What are your strengths and limitations?</h2>
    <P>Empathy is one of strengths as well as being able to take on other peoples problems and not letting it affect me.
<br>
    My limitations consist of my mental health and procrastination.
    </P>
  <h2>How will you manage yourself to work prductively as per the above descriptions?</h2>
    <p>I will regularly take my medication for my mental health and consistently use my coping mechanisms. I will make concious efforts to push past my procrastinating tendancies and eventually make it a habit.
<br>
    If I have any problems I will ask my facilitator my question and while waiting on a response I will do research to try find a solution to my problem.
    </p>
<br>
    <h2>What do you expect from your facilitator?</h2>
    <p>I expect the facilitators to be available to me to answer any questions I might have as well as take the time to contact me if there is any issues they see with my work.</p>
  <h2>Sceduling information</h2>
  <p>i have no sceduling clashes</p>
