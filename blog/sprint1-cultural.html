    <p class="text-box">I have struggled with knowing and understanding my personal values for a long time. I will tell you what I found out about myself so far. Empathy is something I try to display to each and every person I meet. Simply because one has no idea what another is struggling with under the surface. Respect is another value I try to display. Hurting people isn’t something I want to do so just showing general respect and understanding helps prevent that. Just being caring and understanding of who people are and why they might do what they do and accepting that is a big part of who I am. 
<br>
<br>
As someone who cares about other people's feelings and emotions I face a lot of moral dilemmas when I have to; for example cut toxic people out of my life or tell someone the way they are treating me is upsetting. Because it goes against my beliefs. I know I will hurt people. So regardless of who I'm talking to I try to articulate my sentences in a way it reduces the pain I cause them. 
<br>
<br>
My strengths and limitations are not something I am not too in tune with. So I have asked a few good friends of mine what they think. They have told me I am a good listener and that they feel heard when they talk to me about their problems and they don't feel judged. They have also said they admire my generosity. I personally don’t like how generous I am because that opens avenues for people to use me and it's disheartening. Limitations my friends have brought to my attention are that I get distracted easily and let external forces influence my mood severely.
<br>
<br>
I didn't know what was being asked of me when I was asked how my culture influenced my values and beliefs. So I googled it. I learned what culture meant and have determined that this will be difficult to answer because I have my own culture that I have described above. I have also taken the time to go out of my comfort zone to experience other cultures. For example I have gotten to know people in the automotive industry and experienced learning about the culture through tiertery study. I have also been a part of the party scene. But I wasn’t happy there. Through all of these cultural experiences I have learned about what I value most. And what I value most is genuine connection and empathy.
<br>
<br>
My evaluation of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning and work ethic are very contradictory because while being a good listener is excellent for learning, being easily distracted negates my listening ability.
