<h2>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h2>
  <p>
To understand how the principles benefit people we first need to understand what the principles are. The principles that people looking to improve their learning experience need to understand are as follows:
Use it to improve it. This is saying, the more you use that specific brain function the stronger the neuro paths will be. 
Repetition matters. 
Intensity matters. This is saying if you continue to ramp up the difficulty of the information you are learning you will see improvements in your learning capabilities.
Time matters. This is saying changes occur at different times for each person. don’t compare yourself to others.
In understanding these principles. You will stand to gain technically infinite knowledge provided you take the time to use and improve it and remember that repetition and intensity matter.
  </p>

<h2>How will I benefit from these principles and how will I use them?</h2>
  <p>
I feel like if I am to keep these principles in mind while I work it will help me push past the fixed mindset I think I have.
  </p>
<h2>What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
  <p>
First you have to understand that currently people don’t know the full capabilities of the human brain. If you want to learn something you can. To increase your neuroplasticity you need to get into a few good habits. Some suggestions I have are to get good, quality sleep and drink a lot of water. You have to look after your mind as it is before you change how it works. Sticking to the principles mentioned above will also aid you significantly in your neuroplasticity journey.
